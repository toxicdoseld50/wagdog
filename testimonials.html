      <p style="width: 400px">"Lord Wagner is our savior. His Holiness
	agreed to grace our group of young toxicologists with his presence
	on just a few hours notice when our planned speaker was unable to
	attend. He was engaging, funny, and he got rave reviews from all
	the participants. Lord Wagner is personable, well spoken, and very
	intelligent making him an great speaker and mentor for young
	toxicologists. His Holiness' presence at our event was the
	highlight of the week. A select few were even chosen to join the
	Order of the Wagdog after the event and were inducted that very
	week. We cannot thank our Lord enough for everything he has done
	for us."</p>

      <p style="width: 400px">"The Lord and his Lady the Goddess look
	after all those who are lost or in need. During the night of
	celebration Lord Wagner and his Goddess allowed numerous future
	disciples learn the ways of dance at their hands, they showed
	kindness to those who showed impaired judgment, made everyone
	around them laugh and smile and his Holiness even saved a young
	man who had over indulged from a night of ruin. The night of
	celebration would have been dark and lonley without them."</p>
